# System-Analysis-and-Design
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was regarding a company who wanted to create a new online system to help people pass their driving exams. The client wanted a system that would allow people to take online practice exams, schedule driving practice, and take online classes so that they could do better on their test at the DMV.

What did you do particularly well?
I think I did the UML diagrams particularly well because they clearly showed the process and aspects of the Driver System that were important. I also had the most confidence in my understanding of UML diagrams.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the business requirements on the nonfunctional requirements. I would be more specific in what kind of software was necessary for the system to function and system security.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by finding different parts in the system design where I could integrate their requests. It is important to consider the user's needs because a design that is fully functional would be useless if the user is unable to complete their goals. A design without context lacks purpose.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approached designing software by taking each individual element and dissecting it into its rudimentary parts. I did this to identify any possible requirements the system may have and to more precisely provide details on how to implement the system. In the future, I would apply the technique of revisiting a design multiple times to editing before submitting it as the final work since I know that looking at a design with fresh eyes can provide insight to shortcomings that were not originally apparent.
